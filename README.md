Next-gen paper.io userscript/extension. Modifies elements in the paper.io api.

## Installation

Userscripts require a userscript manager to be installed on your computer. Most are common as browser extensions. We recommend [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
Locate the latest version of paper2hack in the `dist` directory, click on it, and click 'raw' at the top.
### Temporary installation
If you would lke to see how this userscript works, you can just paste in the code into the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+J)
